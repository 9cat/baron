{"name":"Baron","tagline":"Baron is a Bitcoin payment processor that anyone can deploy","body":"# Baron [![Gitter chat](http://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-slickage%2Fbaron-1dce73.svg?style=flat)](https://gitter.im/slickage/baron)[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/slickage/baron.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/slickage/baron)\r\nBaron is a Bitcoin payment processor that anyone can deploy\r\n\r\n* Allow creation of invoices denominated in USD or BTC from any other application with the API key.\r\n* Invoices denominated in USD are quoted at market-rate in BTC at the time of payment.\r\n* Records BTC exchange rates when payments are made, useful for accounting.\r\n* Keeps history of all invoices and payments.\r\n* Keeps history of unusual events like reorg, double-spend, etc.\r\n* Properly handles incoming payments after recovering from downtime.\r\n* Notifies external applications via webhooks when an invoice is paid or rendered invalid.\r\n* No lost notifications: monitors for success/failure of webhooks with a retry queue.\r\n\r\n## External Dependencies\r\n* [node](http://nodejs.org)\r\n* [couchdb](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation)\r\n* [bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/download)\r\n* [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)\r\n* [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Running\r\nClone the repository:\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/slickage/baron.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nChange directories to Baron and install dependencies:\r\n```sh\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Baron Configuration\r\nConfigurations can be changed in the config.js file in the root of Baron.\r\n```js\r\nvar config = {\r\n  couchdb: {\r\n    url: process.env.DB_URL || 'http://localhost:5984',\r\n    name: process.env.DB_NAME || 'baron'\r\n  },\r\n  bitcoind:  {\r\n    host: process.env.BITCOIND_HOST || 'localhost',\r\n    port: process.env.BITCOIND_PORT || 18332,\r\n    user: process.env.BITCOIND_USER || 'username',\r\n    pass: process.env.BITCOIND_PASS || 'password'\r\n  },\r\n  port: process.env.PORT || 8080,\r\n  baronAPIKey: process.env.BARON_API_KEY || 'youshouldreallychangethis',\r\n  chainExplorerUrl: process.env.CHAIN_EXPLORER_URL || 'http://tbtc.blockr.io/tx/info',\r\n  updateWatchListInterval: process.env.UPDATE_WATCH_LIST_INTERVAL || 15000,\r\n  lastBlockJobInterval: process.env.LAST_BLOCK_JOB_INTERVAL || 15000,\r\n  webhooksJobInterval: process.env.WEBHOOKS_JOB_INTERVAL || 15000,\r\n  paymentValidForMinutes: process.env.PAYMENT_VALID_FOR_MINUTES || 5,\r\n  trackPaymentUntilConf: process.env.TRACK_PAYMENT_UNTIL_CONF || 100\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n* `couchdb` - Database connection configs\r\n* `bitcoind` - Bitcoin client connetion configs\r\n* `port` - The port that Baron should run on\r\n* `baronAPIKey` - A secret key that is used to validate invoice creation <sup>[1]</sup>\r\n* `chainExplorerUrl` - A link to the tx route of a chain explorer\r\n* `updateWatchListInterval` - How often the watched payments job should run in ms\r\n* `lastBlockJobInterval` - How often the last block job should run in ms\r\n* `webhooksJobInterval` - How often the webhooks job should run in ms\r\n* `paymentValidForMinutes` - How long before exchange rate refreshes for payment\r\n* `trackPaymentUntilConf` - How long to watch payments for before no longer updating\r\n\r\n**NOTES:** \r\n* <sup>[1]</sup> The `baronAPIKey` can be generated using `node generatetoken.js stringToHash`. \r\n* Properties in config.js can be overriden with environment variables.  Common ways to do this is with a [.env](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/#ENVIRONMENT) file and [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or an [EnvironmentFile with systemd](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging%3aSystemd#EnvironmentFiles_and_support_for_.2Fetc.2Fsysconfig_files).\r\n\r\n### Example Bitcoin Configuration\r\nModify bitcoin's [bitcoin.conf](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin#Bitcoin.conf_Configuration_File):\r\n```sh\r\n# (optional) connects bitcoin client to testnet\r\ntestnet=1\r\n\r\n# allows json-rpc api calls from Baron\r\nserver=1\r\n\r\n# these should match your config or .env bitcoind username and password\r\nrpcuser=username\r\nrpcpassword=password\r\n\r\n# tells bitcoind to post wallet/block notifications to baron\r\n# the addresses below should match baron's address and port.\r\nwalletnotify=curl -o /dev/null -s -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data \"{ \\\"txid\\\": \\\"%s\\\", \\\"api_key\\\": \\\"youshouldreallychangethis\\\" }\" http://localhost:8080/walletnotify\r\nblocknotify=curl -o /dev/null -s -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data \"{ \\\"blockhash\\\": \\\"%s\\\", \\\"api_key\\\": \\\"youshouldreallychangethis\\\" }\" http://localhost:8080/blocknotify\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Be sure to customize the two instances of `api_key` within bitcoin.conf to match the `BARON_API_KEY` configuration of Baron.  Additionally the `/walletnotify` and `/bocknotify` URL's must be correct to the hostname and port of your Baron instance and network accessible from the bitcoind.  Please be certain to protect the network between bitcoind and Baron by running it on localhost, within a private network, or VPN.\r\n\r\n### Running Baron\r\nBoth bitcoind and CouchDB must be running and Baron must be correctly configured to reach these external services.\r\n\r\nRunning Baron with [node](http://nodejs.org)\r\n```sh\r\n$ node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning Baron with [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) and [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon)\r\n```sh\r\n$ foreman start -f Procfile-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional Information\r\n\r\n### Invoices\r\n![Invoice Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/9tmBLZL.png)\r\nInvoices allow a person to receive payment for goods or services in BTC. The invoice can be created in USD for a fixed price invoice or in BTC. USD invoices are converted to BTC at time of payment using the current exchange rate for BTC. \r\n\r\nAfter an invoice is created, it can be viewed by going to the /invoices/:invoiceId route. For example:\r\n```sh\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/invoices/8c945af08f257c1417f4c21992586d33\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Invoice Data Model\r\nInvoices have the following properties:\r\n* `api_key` - The API key for Baron to verify that invoice creator is trusted <sup>[1]</sup>\r\n* `currency` - Currency of the invoice, can be either USD or BTC\r\n* `min_confirmations` - Minimum confirmations before a payment is considered paid\r\n* `title`    - ***(optional)*** Title to display at the top of invoices\r\n* `text`     - ***(optional)*** Text to display at the bottom of invoices, may include HTML links\r\n* `expiration` ***(optional)*** - Expiration time for invoice (unix timestamp)\r\n* `webhooks` - ***(optional)*** An object containing event webhooks <sup>[2]</sup>\r\n* `metadata` - ***(optional)*** Container for arbitrary fields, the entire object is passed back to your app in the webhooks.  This can be helpful for apps that do not track invoice ID's.\r\n  * `id` - ***(special)*** If provided, a submission with an identical metadata.id will return the existing matching invoice instead of creating a new invoice.\r\n* `line_items` - Array storing line items\r\n  * `description` - Line item description text\r\n  * `quantity` - Quantity of the item purchased\r\n  * `amount` - The unit cost of the line item <sup>[3]</sup>\r\n\r\n**NOTES:**\r\n* <sup>[1]</sup> The api_key is not stored with the invoice, it is just used for Baron to verify that the invoice creator is trusted.  The api_key of the submitted invoice is compared against the `baronAPIKey` property in config.js.\r\n* <sup>[2]</sup> See the [Webhooks](#webhooks) section below for a more detailed description\r\n* <sup>[3]</sup> Line item amounts are stored in whatever currency the invoice is set to.\r\n\r\nAn example of a new Invoice object:\r\n```js\r\nvar newInvoice = {\r\n    \"api_key\" : \"268f84b93a69bbdf4c5f37dd67196eac75fdcda86dad301cc3fb4aed0670c2cb\",\r\n    \"currency\" : \"BTC\",\r\n    \"min_confirmations\" : 3,\r\n    \"expiration\" : 1399997753000, // Optional\r\n    \"webhooks\" : { // Optional\r\n      \"token\" : \"268f84b93a69bbd\",\r\n      \"paid\" : { \"url\": \"http://example.com/notifypaid\" }\r\n    },\r\n    \"metadata\" : { // Optional\r\n      \"id\" : \"someuser@example.com\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"line_items\" : [\r\n        {\r\n            \"description\" : \"Foo\",\r\n            \"quantity\" : 2,\r\n            \"amount\" : 0.125\r\n        }, \r\n        {\r\n            \"description\" : \"Bar\",\r\n            \"quantity\" : 1,\r\n            \"amount\" : 2.5\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating an Invoice\r\nInvoices can be created by doing a **POST** of the newInvoice object to /invoices route. For example:\r\n```sh\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/invoices\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Payments\r\n![Payment Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ipEhRmg.png)\r\nPayments are created when the 'Pay Now' button on an invoice is clicked. User's are redirected to a view that displays the payment information such as amount due, address and QR Code for fulfillment of the invoice.\r\n\r\nWhen a user's payment reaches the invoice's minimum confirmations, the payment is considered to be in the 'paid' status. Baron also handles other payment statuses:\r\n\r\n| Status   | Description                                                          |\r\n|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|`Paid`    | When the received payment fully pays off an invoice                  |\r\n|`Overpaid`| When the received payment pays more than the invoice required        |\r\n|`Parital` | When the received payment pays less than the invoice required        |\r\n|`Unpaid`  | Payments are unpaid when initially created                           |\r\n|`Pending` | Payments are pending until they reach the invoices min confirmations |\r\n|`Invalid` | Payments that have been reorged or double spent                      |\r\n\r\nPayments can be viewed by going to the /pay/:invoiceId route. For example:\r\n```sh\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/pay/8c945af08f257c1417f4c21992586d33\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Payment Data Model\r\nPayments have the following properties:\r\n* `invoice_id` - Invoice that this payment is associated with\r\n* `address` - Address to send BTC to\r\n* `amount_paid` - Stores the amount that was paid (Always stored in BTC)\r\n* `expected_amount` - Stores the amount that the payment expects to receive\r\n* `block_hash` - Stores the blockhash that the transaction was confirmed into\r\n* `spot_rate` - Stores the exchange rate at the time of payment\r\n* `status` - The status of this payment (paid, unpaid, partial, overpaid, pending, invalid)\r\n* `tx_id` - Stores the transaction ID from bitcoind\r\n* `watched` - Indicates if the payment is actively being watched by Baron\r\n* `created` - Time the payment was created\r\n* `paid_timestamp` - Time that payment became 'paid' status\r\n* `reorg_history` - When applicable, contains the history of block hashes that the transaction was reorged out of\r\n* `double_spent_history` - When applicable, contains the history of transaction ID's that double spent this payment\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is just for reference, all payments are created and handled internally by Baron.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Payment Handling\r\nBaron is able to handle when a bitcoin transaction is reorged, double spent, or mutated. For example:\r\n![Invalid Payment Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/YzszBcQ.png)\r\n\r\nBaron is also able to handle partial payments. When a payment only partially fulfills an invoice the user can click the 'Pay Now' button again, this will create a new payment with the remaining balance. If the user has script enabled the payment page will automatically refresh with an updated remaining balance and payment address. Alternatively user's can also send multiple payments to the same address. \r\n\r\nThis is an example of an invoice that was paid in full by two separate payments:\r\n![Partial Payment Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/sKAsBFu.png)\r\n\r\n## Webhooks\r\nBaron is capable of doing a ***POST*** to a url when a payment event occurs. A payment event is when a payment goes from one status to anther. If a payment was to go from `unpaid` to `paid` status this would trigger the webhook stored in `newInvoice.webhooks.paid`. Here is a full list of supported webhooks:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar newInvoice = {\r\n  //...\r\n  \"webhooks\": {\r\n    \"token\": \"93a69bbdf4c5f37dd6\"\r\n    \"paid\": { \"url\": \"http://example.com/notifypaid\" },\r\n    \"partial\": { \"url\": \"http://example.com/notifypartial\" },\r\n    \"invalid\": { \"url\": \"http://example.com/notifyinvalid\" },\r\n    \"pending\": { \"url\": \"http://example.com/notifypending\" }\r\n  }\r\n  //...\r\n};\r\n```\r\n* `token` - Secret token is posted to the webhook.  This is typically used to authenticate the connection when Baron posts the status notification to the webhook.  Identifying information about the Invoice may optionally be passed within the `metadata` field, described above.\r\n* `url` - The url Baron should ***POST*** to when the payment event occurs\r\n\r\n### Webhook Verification\r\nThe app notified by the webhook can trust the incoming payment notification because it has a matching secret token that was set when the Invoice was created. Further information about the Invoice can optionally be queried from Baron via the `/api/invoices/:invoiceId` route.  For example, the Invoice can be verified as paid if `is_paid` is `true`.\r\n\r\n**Security Consideration**\r\n\r\nBoth the webhook and payment status check can be subject to attack if intra-app communication is over the Internet without the protection of SSL. Verification with `/api/invoices/:invoiceId` can successfully guard against a forged payment if at least the Baron side is protected by SSL. You can avoid these issues by communicating over an internal network or VPN between the two apps.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
